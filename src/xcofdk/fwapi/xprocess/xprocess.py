# Interface
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class XProcess(_XProcessBase):
    """
    This class represents the heavy-weight counterpart of class XTask.

    Instances of this class are child processes, basically constructed by
    passing a callable object. Later, they can be started for parallel execution
    with the launching task continues its own exection as usual.

    For quick orientation and guidance on by when to use what, the interface is
    arranged in logical, context-driven subsets each labeled by a comment block
    of the form:
        >>> # --------------------------------------------------------------
        >>> # title of interface subset
        >>> # --------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently available interface subsets of class XProcess are as follows:
        1) constructor / initializer
        2) API basic process properties
        3) API start/stop
        4) API process state

    Sections below explain terms, definitions and related concepts of the
    framework dealing with parallel processes.


    Multiprocessing (MP):
    -----------------------
    refers to framwork's subsystem and capability to create and start new,
    processes on one hand, while enabling applications to communicate with
    other processes (probably already existing and running) on the other hand.

    In general, with regard to its logical and/or technical purpose, a process
    may be:
        - an instance of this class created and started from within
          a running instance of the framework using Python's standard library
          'multiprocessing' (and its relted class 'Process').

          Such a process is either a forked or a spawned child process (see
          start methods below), often as a preferred option for parallel
          execution of a so-called CPU-bound piece of code.

        - an arbitrary process (or program) running either on the host machine
          or on a remotely connected machine over network. Note that such a
          process is assumed to be any possible single- or multithreaded
          application. It especially can be another running instance of XCOFDK,
          or a spawned child process using Python's library 'subprocess'.

          In this case framework's focus is rather shifted to its interface for
          process communication which is part of the subsystem messaging, too.
          That is, a process which is a messaging endpoint needs to be provided
          by a unique identifier only, but not necessarily represented as a
          process object (of some specific class, e.g. XProcess).


    Interface of MP:
    -----------------
    as indicated above, MP-related interface of the framework is given by:
        - process communication:
          covered by the subsystem of messaging explained in class description
          of XMessageManager,

        - child processes:
          are provided as instances of class XProcess as well as thier
          management and error handling.

      Representing an abstraction of another type of executable artifacts (also
      refered to as 'host processes' provided by the host programming language
      or operating system) class XProcess is designed to have a similar
      look-and-feel as given for class XTask enabling applications to a uniform
      interfacing as much as possible and feasible.

      However, class XProcess as presented here is not complete yet. It is rather
      considered a kickoff version. Especially the supplementary interfaces
      related to both management and in-depth error handling are part of work
      still in progress. Same is true for both the restrictions related to
      limited RTE modes (see XTask) and the abovementioned process communication
      incorporating running processes started from outside the framework.


    Process start method:
    ------------------------
    refers to the mechanism Python's MP library 'multiprocessing' uses to start
    child processes, explained in the respective section of the official
    documentation page:
        - Contexts and start methods
          https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods

    Process start methods supported by Python's MP are:
        - spawn
        - fork
        - forkserver

    with the related getter and setter functions of the library are:
        - multiprocessing.get_start_method()
        - multiprocessing.set_start_method()

    It is important to notice that the process start method shall be set only
    once by program's main module (named '__main__') as pointed out in the
    official documentaton, see:
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_start_method

    Hence, framework considers setting of the desired process start method as
    an issue solely to be done by applications, it never changes its current
    value returned by the abovementioned getter function. Moreover, as soon as
    a change of the process start method is detected, (subsequent) requests to
    create new instances of class XProcess will be refused by the framework for
    the rest of the life-cycle at hand.

    Finally, with regard to a child process created and started via interface of
    MP (expained above) of the framework (acting as its parent process, then),
    awareness of three important aspects of child processes is necessary:
        - threading
        - termination
        - performance


    Threading of child processes:
    --------------------------------
    unless intended for parallel execution of a (CPU-bound) piece of code, they
    also may be arranged as ordinary multithreaded programs. Hence, It is
    application's responsibility to ensure that such a threaded child process in
    connection with the chosen process start method (see above) does not end up
    in potential deadlocks.

    This is especially true for forked child processes classified as 'unsafe
    for multithreading' as they inherit all ressources (including lock objects)
    of the parent process by making use of (OS-dependent) function 'os.fork()'
    for the implementation of their instantiation and start, see:
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fork


    Termination of child processes:
    --------------------------------
    if not terminated yet, attempts to terminate running child processes (from
    within the parent process) become a critical issue, especially if a child
    process is performing some long-term computation right now, or even worse
    if it is stuck in some deadlock(s).

    As the framework is commited to both reliability and responsiveness at any
    time, this issue is of utmost importance, especially if requested to do so
    by the application, or when shutting down (see sections 'LC management' and
    'Coordinated shutdown sequence' of class description of XTaskError).

    Therefore, regardless of the mechanism picked out by the framework to
    initate the termination of a running/stuck child process, the general
    approach follows the pattern of either request-reply (as for tasks) or
    fire-and-forget.

    All in all, the process of both stopping and shuting down a child process
    is equippped with the so-called 'provision for non-daemonic' child
    processes meaning:
        a) child processes, i.e. instances of class XProcess, are not
           daemonic, hence they are not auto-terminated upon termination of
           the parent process,

        b) they are rather ordinary processes allowed to have their own child
           processes,

        c) their termination (if necessary) by the framework is done on the
           aforementioned managed basis limited to child process started by
           the framework only,

        d) they are responsible for termination of their own child processes
           (if any) to avoid the issue of orphaned children.


    Performance of child processes:
    ----------------------------------
    measured as the cost of the consumed CPU time for execution, performance of
    child processes is out of the functional socpe of the framework, too. Its
    related interface (and implementation) is primarily responsible for creation
    and tracking of their execution state in a way it doesn't have a worsening
    impact on the performance and responsiveness of the parent process, that is
    the framework itself.
