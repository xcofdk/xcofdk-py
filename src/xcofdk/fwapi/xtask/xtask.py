# Interface
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class XTask(_XTaskBase):
    """
    Abstract class representing application tasks to be executed by the
    framework.

    Concrete task instances can be created by sub-classing this class.
    Derived classes will have to override specific callback methods according
    to the corresponding properties (explained below) of the task profile
    passed to the constructor when a task instance is created.

    Tasks are designed to achieve light-weight parallelism (or concurrency),
    but applications may also require the ability to start and/or to communicate
    with processes, that is programs running in parallel. For this, class
    XProcess is provided as the heavy-weight counterpart of class XTask.

    Class XTask has a rich set of interface functions. For quick orientation
    and guidance on by when to use which one, the interface is arranged in
    logical, context-driven subsets each of them labeled by a comment block of
    the form:
        >>> # --------------------------------------------------------------
        >>> # title of interface subset
        >>> # --------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently available interface subsets of class XTask are as follows:
        1) constructor / initializer
        2) API to be overridden when sub-classing
        3) API start/stop
        4) API task state and properties
        5) API message handling
        6) API error handling

    With regard to application code using and interfacing to the runtime
    environment of the framework class XTask is ideally suited for a general
    introduction of the basics. Sections below explain terms, definitions and
    related concepts of the framework, especially tasks.


    Host thread:
    --------------
    XCOFDK is designed to be a reliable, out-of-the-box runtime environment
    for both multithreading and multiprocessing. It is built around so-called
    threads provided by the underlying host programming language (and/or host
    operating system) with threading capability for execution of user-defined
    sequences of instructions.

    In case of XCOFDK for Python, it is implemented on top of instances of class
    'threading.Thread'. A task instance created by the framework and presented
    to an application as a (carefully assembled) executable artifact is always
    linked and associated to its underlying thread object underneath.

    As both thread and task are often used as synonyms, the term 'host thread'
    is particularly used whenever framework's design (or implementation) has
    to emphasize abovementioned association between task as an abstraction
    of its thread underneath.

    By design, framework's support of host threads is not limited to a specific
    type of thread objects only. Work is in progress to support other types of
    host threads, too, especially when it comes to make XCODFK is supporting
    third-party (GUI-) frameworks with their own, specific abstraction of both
    threading and parallelism at the latest.


    Execution frame 3-PhXF:
    -------------------------
    The so-called '3-phased execution frame' builds both conceptual and
    functional aspeccts of instances of this class reflected by below callback
    methods in the given order:
        >>> XTask.SetUpXTask()     # -> setup phase
        >>> XTask.RunXTask()       # -> run phase
        >>> XTask.TearDownXTask()  # -> teardown phase

    An exception to the abovementioned attribution of execution phases is
    whenever a task's external message queue (if any) is specified to be
    blocking. For such a task the run phase is then represented by its callback
    method below:
        >>> XTask.ProcessExternalMessage()  # -> run phase

    As a sum-up, 3-PhXF means that an application task is always an instance of
    a user-defined, derived class, e.g. 'MyTask', subclassing XTask which
    overrides the callback methods mentioned above according to the possible
    task profiles (see section 'Configuration' below) targeted by that
    user-defined class roughly shaped as follows:
        >>>
        >>> # file: my_task.py
        >>>
        >>> from xcofdk.fwcom       import override
        >>> from xcofdk.fwcom       import ETernaryCallbackResultID
        >>> from xcofdk.fwapi.xtask import XTask
        >>> from xcofdk.fwapi.xtask import XTaskProfile
        >>> from xcofdk.fwapi.xmsg  import XMessage
        >>>
        >>> class MyTask(XTask):
        >>>     def __init__(self, *args_, **kwargs_):
        >>>         super().__init__(taskProfile_=XTaskProfile())
        >>>         # ...
        >>>
        >>>     @override
        >>>     def SetUpXTask(self, *args_, **kwargs_) -> ETernaryCallbackResultID:
        >>>         pass
        >>>
        >>>     @override
        >>>     def RunXTask(self, *args_, **kwargs_) -> ETernaryCallbackResultID:
        >>>         pass
        >>>
        >>>     @override
        >>>     def TearDownXTask(self) -> ETernaryCallbackResultID:
        >>>         pass
        >>>
        >>>     @override
        >>>     def ProcessExternalMessage(self, xmsg_ : XMessage) -> ETernaryCallbackResultID:
        >>>         pass
        >>>
        >>>     # ...


    Configuration:
    ---------------
    The specification of 3-PhXF of a task instance is always done via
    corresponding setter properties of the task profile argument passed to
    the initializer when creating that task instance:
        >>> XTaskProfile.isSetupPhaseEnabled     = [True | False]
        >>> XTaskProfile.isTeardownPhaseEnabled  = [True | False]

        >>> # (or in case of blocking external queue)
        >>> XTaskProfile.isExternalQueueEnabled   = [True | False]
        >>> XTaskProfile.isExternalQueueBlocking  = [True | False]

    Unless the last two properties both resolve to True, the callback method
    'RunXTask()' represents the run phase which is the default configuration.
    Otherwise, the callback method 'ProcessExternalMessage()' will serve as
    run phase.

    Finally, configuration of task's (external/interal) message queues, and so
    their respective callback methods, is an essential part of the subsystem
    messaging of the framework explained in more detail in class description
    of XMessageManager.


    Asymmetric task state transition:
    -----------------------------------
    Tasks are accompanied by a corresponding state transition as they pass
    through their execution phases of 3-PhXF. Except for the transitional
    states, three task states are mostly relevant to application code
    interfacing with tasks:
        - running
        - stopped
        - failed (i.e. aborted)

    Both last states are final, and it is framework's responsibility to ensure
    that tasks reach one of them based on the state transition history before.

    State 'stopped' means:
        task has finished its execution path upon normal termination,
        especially without causing any fatal error.
        Note, however, thinkng of a task as a job executor, the logical
        interpretation of this state might be different, especially from
        application's viewpoint. Such a logical interpretation is considered
        by the framework application-specific with it is best designed and
        implemented by derived class(es) sub-classing this class.

    State 'failed' means:
        task has aborted its execution by intention, or submitted a fatal error
        by intention, or crashed (i.e. caused an unexpected exception).

    State 'running' means:
        task is still within its setup or run phase.
        But, tasks within their teardown phase (if configured), are rather in
        their transitional state 'stopping'.

    Teardown phase (if configured) serves as an opportunity for local cleanup
    purposes of free-of-fatal-error tasks. Therefore, the framework considers
    this execution phase rather a 'pure transitional' phase (possibly towards
    true ternimation of the underlying host thread if the task is an
    asynchronous one, see below). Accordingly, limited functionality in terms
    of available framework API is granted to tasks in this phase.

    This is what makes state transition of tasks 'asymmetric' with regard to
    their 3-PhXF on one hand, and from interfacing point of view on the other
    hand (see also RTE modes below).

    Finally, note that while tasks provide interface funcitons to start, stop
    or join them, there is no correspondent one to 'abort' them.
    Aborting a task is considered by the framework a critical, reserved
    operation. It is only possible either from within that task's 3-PhXF by
    the task itself and by intention, or by the framework because of some fatal
    error caused by them.


    Currently running task:
    -------------------------
    In this documentation the term 'running' is used in two different contexts
    when application tasks are of concern:
        1) 'task state running' (as described above),
        2) 'currently running task' meaning more precisely the instance of XTask
           whose associated host thread is currently executed (by the scheduler
           of the host OS) within any one of execution phases of its 3-PhXF
           regardless its current task state.

    Unless otherwise needed, and also for more readability, reader's awareness
    of the given context will be assumed.


    Task types:
    ------------
    There are two types of tasks with respect to their execution:
        - synchronous, meaning task is executed within the execution context
          of currently running host thread,
        - asynchronous, meaning task is executed within the execution context
          of a new, to be created host thread.

    The corresponding setter property of the task profile to specifiy the
    execution type is:
        >>> XTaskProfile.isSynchronousTask = [True | False]


    RTE modes:
    -------------
    From interfacing point of view of an application using the runtime
    environment (RTE for short) of XCOFDK, instaaces of class XTask (as well as
    of class XProcess) are key components provided by the framework to the
    application as active services.

    Unless otherwise oranized or configured by the application, availability of
    the public API of the framework is granted to task instances as long as RTE
    is in normal, unrestricted operational mode.

    However, there are two limited operational modes tasks (or processes)
    provided to the application should be aware of:
        - local-limited RTE mode:
          affecting individual services.
          It is currently the case whenever a task instance is within its
          teardown phase (if configured).

        - global-limited RTE mode:
          affecting all active services.
          It basically takes place as sson as the coordinated shutdown sequence
          of the framework taskes place.

    In general, whenever a limited RTE mode is given, an active service won't
    be able to perform message exchange anymore. In addition, for global-limited
    RTE mode below functionalities are not available either:
        - create, start, stop or join tasks (or process).

              Frozen task profiles are read-only, their properties cannot be
              changed anymore.
            - Note, that the task profile argument passed to the constructor
              (if any) remains not-frozen, so it basically can still be modified

        ------
            - A task is always associated with its current error only (if any)
              which is either a user error or a fatal error.
            - A current fatal error can only be cleared by a task itself
              during the qualification process of submitted fatal errors.
            - A current user error is auto-cleared by the framework before
              entering any of the phases of 3-PhXF (in case of run phase before
              starting next run cycle). That is tasks starts their phases of
              3-PhXF always in an error-free state.
            - Fatal errors have precedence over user errors, that is submitting
              a fatal error overwrites existing current user error (if any).
            - In all other cases where a task is already associated with its
              current user/fatal error, submitting subsequent user/fatal errors
              for that task does not touch its current user/fatal error.
              In other words, unless current error is resolved (or cleared),

            True if the operation succeeded, False otherwise.

        Note:
        ------
