Multithreaded user application 'exampleSCB21':
  - title        : XMTGuiAppMessaging - SC
  - location     : ~/xcofdk/tests/xuserapp/basic/xmt/sc/exampleSCB21/
  - description  : This Tk application uses a synchronous main task and multiple asynchronous service tasks.
                   It demostrates general use of multiple tasks.
  - remark(s)    : a) The application is made quite parameterized to serve as 'generic application'
                      used by other examples wherever applicable.
                   b) It also is used to highlight basic features of the subsystem messaging.
                   c) This example uses subclassing (SC) approach to create application tasks.
                      However, it is presented for demonstration purposes only.
                      Epecially, it does not represent any add-value example in terms of task abstraction and/or
                      features compared to its RC counterpart.
