Multithreaded user application '_exampleSCB10':
  - title        : XMTUnitTest
  - location     : ~/xcofdk/tests/xuserapp/basic/xmt/sc/exampleSCB10
  - description  : This console application provides a basic sample for programs using XCOFDK.
                   Also, it is properly designed to be tested by Python's Unit testing framework 'unittest'.
  - remark(s)    : This example uses subclassing (SC) approach to create application tasks.
                   However, it is presented for demonstration purposes only.
                   Epecially, it does not represent any add-value example in terms of task abstraction and/or
                   features compared to its RC counterpart.
